        Development and Practice for leveraging Functional Programming Paradigm techniques as well as utilizing the powerful NPM Scripting capabilities within the <<<< package.json >>>> "dependancy managment file for development task, testing, uglification and minification, bundling, and dependancy managment for a Node.js Server-Side Application that utilizes templating for HTML generation coupled with noSQL database modeling through MongoDB integration and mongoose's flexible versatility. Synthesize Node.js with Express to encorporate the templating distinctiveness of express-handlebars with its minimalist, and  enterprising templating engine.

<!--todo            <<<< Backlog >>>>               -->

        1.  Configuration of the Node.js Server-Side Application and its dependencies.
        2.  Create the 'file-directory-structure' with the initial file allocations.
        3.  Generate the package.json file and LOAD the Application's dependencies.
        4.  Generate the <<<< README.md >>>> file.
        5.  Generate the <<<< .gitignore >>>> file.
        6.  Generate the <<<< .eslintrc >>>> file.
        7.  Create an MIT License file.
        8.  Generate the <<<< .npmignore >>>> file.
        9.  Implementation of an < .env > for production and development environments.
        10. Automate a jest.config.js file for Unit & Integration testing (TDD).
        11. Automate a <<<< .babelrc >>>> file for transpiling ES6 to ES5.
        12. HOOT Webelistics plan to adhere to the asychronous explicit syntax of ES6's imports and exports, which dynamically loads modules versus the old-school static implicit nature of the Node.js's require() function. Happy will be the day when all applicable software development tools will support the new syntax; O Yeah! Despite the fact that the new syntax is not yet widely adopted, it is a great opportunity to learn the new syntax and its benefits. In with the NEW and OUT with the OLD. It's time gentlemen to settle this fight once and for all.
        13. Create the handlebar templates, the main.handlebar in the layouts directory along with any partials that are required. Possibly code any handlers that are also required.
        14. Modernizing the architecture of the Application's Routing structure, so that each route will be a separate module incorporating modularity and encapsulation. Modularization coupled with encapsulation are the two key principles of the pervasive functional programming paradigm. Utilizing these progressive virtues HOOT Webelistics will build this Node.js Server-Side Application assured of the benefits of exploiting the foundational and typical archetype of modularity along with creating an application that will be easily re-used and capable of being re-configured and re-purposed.
        15. Create the Schemas & Models for the MongoDB database and the Mongoose ORM.
        16. Design the front-end UI for the Application. Apply intuitive, responsive, and accessible design principles to the front-end UI.
        17. With modularity and encapsulation at the forefront of the development process, the User-Interface will be componentized and modularized. Incorporating 'Web Components' is simply the next logical step in the development process. HOOT Webelistics will utilize the Web Components paradigm to create a reusable, modular, and reusable UI. Web Components are native to the browser, and with JavaScript, with an even greater caveat in that CSS, the styling tool for development, can ambiguously be applied to the components without conflict to the rest of the application. The persistency of the components will be the key to the success of the application. The Web Components will not be coupled with any frameworks and be without any dependencies or edge-cases concerning versioning or any interoperability issues.
        Web Components will naturally progress with the browser's evolution, and will be the foundation for the future of the application. This is counter-intuitive
        in the world of web development wherein in the process of time there are many issues with broken dependencies due to versioning and continuing forward compatibility. In a nutshell, you can not go wrong with Web Components. The proper combination of design configuration, event handling that's arrayed properly with state management, and finally a steadfastness in adherence to Test-Driven-Development(TDD) and coding 'Best Practices', the end product will be a robust, stable, and scalable application that's easily maintained. So, it's time to get excited and start coding! It just feels good to know that what you're doing, and the way you are doing it, is the right thing to do and that it is right right right!!!
