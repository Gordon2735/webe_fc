//~ Introducing the "World-Wide" "Amalgamation->/<>/<-that's Conflating" the Dichotomy ~//
//~ Utilizing a technological-dissolution, smartly triumphing over the arcane seperation ~//
//~ triggering repudiation of the fractal-state Physiologically surrounding while surveiling
//~ the singularity existent convoluting Desktop & Internet Applicational perspectivity;   ~//
//npm : and that irrefutably universal & incontestable! With a determinate technological diviation
//~   coupled with an emotional assertion, purposefully ensconced traversing this necessary journey
//~ in search of a software developmental equality. Acqusitioning and achievment
//~ of a compositional unanimity amongst the software engineering community brought this
//~ journey anomalously close to nearly becoming a type of Observational Astronomy.
//~ Experiencing such a wonderful astronomical expanse beholding observables
//~ originating from the sun and being configured with a certain angular deviation,
//~  that suggestively, from its perihelion moved a planet.
//~ From a vantage point of luminosity, the observatory of the darker regions,
//~ comes with revelatory awakenings and certain emperical findings maneuvering an almost achieving equity from a coherced observational
//~ reality. Wow! That was years of a confined and compounded inferiority
//~ complex made manifest from an innocently acquired, but surley a mistakenly false
//~ understanding, by the software engineering community,  concerning the Desktop developmental
//~ processes and environments having a percieved superiority beholdant contrarily with regards concerning the Internet developmental
//~  environments with their processes.
// ~ I have this to say from a business perspective and its point of view:
//~ I will commence this quick dissertational perspective by saying that you are probably smarter.
//~ Notwithstanding, there are many more similarities than differences between the Desktop and the Internet
//~ developmental environments. You might have to manufacture the thread and then assemble
//~ that pair of programmatical pants; spending what i perceive reseembles
//~ an engineer's revelation of an eternity. What's magically manifest in the Front & Back End
//~ of the software development environments is a software development process that's
// ~ very progressive and intuitiveness wherewith it brandishes the engineer more time to be artful and creative.
//~ You can blame in on a dynamically typed stone-aged programming language,
//~ but if an intellectually equal engineer built from our side of the isle,
//~ he would produce a quality software product that can be just as successful
//~ in its propietary and creative ways. C and C++ are great languages, far better suited
//~ for certain design strategies than other's; the same is true of the Internet
//~  development software and environments.
//~ Furthermore, I'm sure we've heard these same arguments over and over again.
//~ So here is where I'll deviate from the norm. I'm not out to prove one way
//~ or the other. I'm just here to promote a 360 degree opportunity for
// ~ developers of every ilk. The opportunity is before us like never before.
//~ JavaScript Developers have tools such as Electron which enable us to cross the isle
//~ and apply our talents against the thresholds of our ability. You might say yeah right.
//~ Hey, the speed of the average computer is viable and ready for operation! To operate with these programs
//~ the operator won't be aware of any difference what so ever. Heck, I use
//~ VS Code everyday and it was written using Electron. The original base
//~ language is probably C, so what. I'm not going to reinvent the wheel//
//~  Everytime I want to roll. Let's build our products standing upon the SHOULDERS
//~  of programming GIANTS, and there's nothing to be ashamed of.
//~ Truth be told, and be known, I didn't build these clothes I'm wearing, neither
// ~ did I build the shoes I wear. I'm just here to promote a 360 degree opportunity
// ~ for developers to come together, sharing the same passion and skills, and
// ~ create business solutions and applications that will be a credible part of the future,
// ~ and make their mark on the world.
