Initialize and Integrate an 'entrance-point' between the front-end
(HTML-JavaScript-CSS) "init" application and the back-end
(Node.js-Express_Handlebars-MongoDB ) "Server.js" application
by loading DOM Tree and Component Elements into the 'server-side'
Handlebars middleware's "Layout Template" main.handlebars.
Now, with the initialization and integration of our back-end & front-end
software applications, the iterable "FUN BEGINS" at "Hoot WebelisticsÂ®":
This robust Web-Application (SINGULAR), defines a new-world of Internet
interrelationality and Interactions, by establishing smartly the wonderful
and powerful new-world of Web-Technology. Traversing this new-world seamlessly,
our Application's integrated software communicates and interacts cohesively
has 'ONE-UNIT'; by collectively having had the inadequate functionality, bugs,
and every 'COUNTER-INTUITIVE' element of the application's architecture
systematically and methodically eliminated.
Building applications with the Industry's Standard "Best-Practices".
These practices are then coupled intuitively with a "TDD"/"TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT" Process:
HOOT Webelistics is building and testing from design, exclusively having
the software code engineered and written within a test; irrevocably the Application's
code originates in a test before its implementation into the Core Application, proving
its testability even before its functionality. HOOT Webelistics' Application's Development
is professionally engineered from its Genesis of Primary-Investgative-Research
before the conclusion of being a Refactored-Distilled-Maturation: thereby manifesting
itself has a 'THOUROUGHLY TESTED', "Production-Ready-Software-Application"!
To be sure,  having reached this stage of development, the Application's maintenence,
and life-cyle productiveness, will prove to be a "SUSTAINABLE" and "EFFICIENT" Internet Tool.
